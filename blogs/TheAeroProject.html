        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div>
            Aero is a new Stepmania 5.1 mod framework I developed to make mod
            charts easier. I believe these types of frameworks should give the
            user as much ease of access to useful functions as possible without
            being in the way of what the user wants to do.

        <h2>Why did I make this?</h2>
        <div>
            My previous mod template I made and was using was <i>horrible</i> to
            work with. Rather than having the template functions be embedded in
            the mod code environment, my template would return a dictionary
            containing all the functions which I would then have to refrence as
            a variable to use the premade functions. Needless to say this was a
            <i>shitty</i> way of doing this. And so to make my life easier I
            decided to remake the template from the ground up in the form of
            Aero, implementing things that would make it easy to create mod
            charts.

        <h2>Mod template's already exist though</h2>
        <div>
            I am aware that other templates exist, infact the
            <a href="https://github.com/XeroOl/notitg-mirin">Mirin template</a>
            was a big inspiration as to how some functions in Aero were named,
            even the parameter order of said functions are exactly as mirin's. I
            began this project not as something to replace any other mod
            template but rather a learning experience, I needed to make this to
            prove to myself I could make something better than my old template
            file. That being said I would be happy if anybody try out
